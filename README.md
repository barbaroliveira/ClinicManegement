# Clinic Roladex
This project is going to use the knowledge learned in the project monsters roladex but aplied to a dentary clinic.
Here I planed to make a step-by-step of what was done and the problems that were encoutered in the path of building our clinic roladex App.

## Create React App
This project is going to use create react app

## Data used
In the monster roladex project we use an API to fetch the data of the monsters, but as our aplication isn't going to use an API at this moment, we hardcoded 3 clinics data to make the cards component that are going to be searched.
In the future the idea is to create a component that can be used to add a new clinic and link this app to a database.
